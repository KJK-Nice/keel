## Install

**macOS 13 or later** (Apple Silicon and Intel): download `keel-*.dmg`, open it and drag **Keel.app** to Applications. If the release is not notarized by Apple (its notes say so), the first launch is blocked: open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to "Keel was blocked…" and click **Open Anyway**, or run

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Keel.app
```

The `keel` command (`keel serve`, `keel mcp`, `keel version`) is `/Applications/Keel.app/Contents/MacOS/Keel`.

**Linux** (x86_64 is `amd64`): the window is Keel's own (not a web view), so there is no WebKitGTK to install; it needs GTK 3, and the package carries `libghostty-vt.so`, the terminal engine, beside the binary. What the desktop itself must provide for a window is MyGo's concern (<https://github.com/egoist/mygo>); Keel's CI does not run on Linux windows, so the Linux build is not checked there.

```bash
# Debian, Ubuntu: /opt/keel, the `keel` command and a menu entry
sudo apt install ./keel_*_amd64.deb      # or _arm64.deb
# any distribution
mkdir keel && tar -xzf keel-*-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C keel && ./keel/keel   # or -arm64
```

**keel-signal**, the server for sharing sessions over the internet, is in the `keel-signal-*` archives; see [Sharing](https://github.com/KJK-Nice/keel/blob/main/docs/sharing.md). Release builds have no signaling server set: Share stays off until you enter one in **Settings → Sharing → Signal server**.

Check a download against `SHA256SUMS` with `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing`.
